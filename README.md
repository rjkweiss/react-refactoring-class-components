# Refactor Widgets App

Refactor the Class Components in an existing React
application into Function Components. By doing the following:

* Use the `useState` Hook to convert state instance variables to function-based
  state variables
* Explain the use cases for the lifecycle methods `componentDidMount`,
  `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`, as well as when each will
  run
* Use `useEffect` to replicate the behavior of those lifecycle methods while
  also understanding how the application of `useEffect` differs from those
  methods
* Use `useRef` to create a ref that will persist across renders
* Use React Testing Library tests running on a Jest framework to confirm the
  accuracy of your refactor
